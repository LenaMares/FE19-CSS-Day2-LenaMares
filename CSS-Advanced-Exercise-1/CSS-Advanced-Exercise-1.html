          <h3>Tesla Lithium Refinery Groundbreaking</h3>
          <p>The Tesla Team, May 8th 2023</p>
          <p>
            Today, we are breaking ground on Tesla’s in-house lithium refinery,
            located in the greater Corpus Christi area of Texas. Once complete,
            the facility will represent an investment of >$1B in Southwest
            Texas. This investment is critical to our mission to accelerate the
            world’s transition to sustainable energy and represents our efforts
            to aggressively increase the supply of battery-grade lithium
            hydroxide available in North America.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 1,200+ acre site will be the location of the first industrial
            deployment of an acid-free lithium refining route. This process
            eliminates the use of hazardous reagents and byproducts in favor of
            more inert options. The byproduct from this facility, a mixture of
            sand and limestone, is useful in the production of construction
            materials, making beneficial use of traditional waste streams.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the future, we expect this facility to also process other
            intermediate lithium feedstocks, including recycled batteries and
            manufacturing scrap.
          </p>

          <p>
            The construction effort will create nearly 1,000 construction jobs,
            and the facility will employ upwards of 250 full time employees,
            including production technicians, operations managers and
            engineering roles to support ongoing plant maintenance and
            optimization.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are also committed to building talent pipelines in the greater
            Coastal Bend area through education investments in the Robstown
            Independent School District, apprenticeship pathways at Del Mar
            Community College and internship opportunities with Texas A&M Corpus
            Christi.
